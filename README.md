# ctrl-f
make words visible though ctrl-f. inspired by a lame copypasta. [try it](http://codepen.io/abbott/pen/NALRWw)

everything's kind of hardcoded so it only works with alphanumeric, a-z0-9, so far. I might add support for more characters later, but don't get your hopes up.

### Example
Probably won't show up that well on github since it relies on the text being more or less monospaced, that's why I made the filler text numbers instead of letters.


Ctrl + f then put in 9
